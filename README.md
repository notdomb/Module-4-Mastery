During module 4, I was able to create a Cubed python program.
This CUBE.py is used to show cubic numbers. 
It will first show the first 5 cubic numbers, then it will show the next 5000 cubic numbers.

The next two files, "all_day.geojson.json" and "earthquakes.py" go together. 
When downloading these two files, replace the "file_path = C:/..." with the file path to the "all_day.geojson.json" file.
This is to prevent errors when running the code, since it depends on you having the actual file.
This is my favorite one because it plots recent earthquakes that happened during the week.

The next project included the "learning_python.txt" and "repeat_learning.py". 
After downloading these files, make sure to change the file path in the python program to the location of the "learning_python.txt" file
This project the sentences from "learning_python" to repeat the sentences in multiple different ways.
It also replaces the word python, with any word, or language that you choose.

The last project uses "main.py" and "modis_2023_United_States.csv" 
Just like the other projects, in the python file, change the file path to where the csv file is downloaded
This project plots recent fires that happened on the map of the world.
